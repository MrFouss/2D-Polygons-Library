/**
 * DESCRIPTION OF THE FILE:
 * ------------------------
 * This file is used to introduce the "Status" data type, used to compare two polygons' locations.
 * Since no new specifications where given, we decided to add a new status called "SAMESHAPE".
 * This status defines two polygons that take the exact same space, but can't be defined as equal.
